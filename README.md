# 🌩️ Cloud DevOps Lab – Foundations for Real-World Infrastructure

This repository documents my self-led Cloud & DevOps project, designed to apply real-world workflows using public cloud services, open-source tools, and automation techniques.

---

## 📘 Background

I’m currently transitioning into a Cloud & DevOps Engineer role, supported by my academic background — a **Master of Information Technology (Computer Networking)** — with key subjects including:

- **Cloud Computing**  
- **Cloud Privacy & Security** (Distinction)  
- **Information Security**  
- **IT Risk Management**

This project bridges theoretical knowledge with practical application through hands-on labs, experimentation, and self-guided builds on **Azure**, **Linux**, and **containerized environments**.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Cloud**: Azure  
- **OS**: Ubuntu Linux  
- **Scripting**: Bash  
- **Containers**: Docker  
- **IaC**: Terraform *(in progress)*  
- **Version Control**: Git (CLI)  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions *(learning phase)*  

---

## 🔧 Key Implementations

- Provisioned Linux-based Azure Virtual Machines with secure SSH key access  
- Configured firewall rules, subnets, DNS, and NAT policies aligned with cloud networking principles  
- Wrote Bash scripts for log cleanup, user automation, and directory backups  
- Installed and configured Docker containers (e.g., Nginx) using bind mounts and persistent volumes  
- Practiced Git-based version control and documented all procedures using Markdown  

---

## 🚀 Current Focus

- Building and deploying multi-container environments using **Docker Compose**  
- Creating reusable infrastructure templates with **Terraform**  
- Exploring **CI/CD workflows** using GitHub Actions  
- Enhancing cloud-native networking (VNets, NSGs, DNS zones)  
- Applying IAM and security concepts from academic studies in live configurations

---

## 📈 Learning Goals

- Reinforce core DevOps concepts through repetition and problem-solving  
- Build a portfolio of modular, reproducible cloud environments  
- Document everything in a clear, professional, and reusable format  
- Prepare for Cloud/DevOps roles by October 2025 with both practical and academic credibility

---

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned So Far

- The importance of methodical problem-solving when dealing with cloud infrastructure  
- How theoretical networking and security concepts map to live environments  
- Confidence working with CLI tools, Git, and remote Linux systems  
- How to break large cloud workflows into manageable components
